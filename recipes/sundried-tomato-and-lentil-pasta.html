       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>This dish is ideal for nights when you're tired from work. It is quick, easy, and doesn't require much thought. Recipe serves two people.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>250g Spaghetti (Use wholegrain for extra protein and fibre)</li>
        <li>1 Tin of Green Lentils</li>
        <li>1 Jar of Sundried tomato paste (I use the Sainsbury's offering)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Balsamic Vinegar</li>
        <li>Table Salt (fine, not coarse)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Onion powder</li>
       </ul>
       <p> Note: This recipe assumes you have a colander or sieve to drain the pasta and lentils.</p>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Add two pinches of salt to a pot of water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li> Add pasta and begin to cook in accordance with packet instructions, or to your liking.</li>
        <li>Whilst the pasta is cooking, drain the lentils and set aside</li>
        <li>Fill kettle with 250ml of water and pre-boil in case more water needs to be added to saucepan later.</li>
        <li>Add lentils to the pot 3 mins from time of pasta being finished. This is where that extra bit of water can come in handy. If you need to add more water, make sure to re-boil it before adding it to the pot. Note: you can cook the lentils in a separate pot if you like. If you choose to do so, cook the lentils at a moderate heat for 4-5 mins. </li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium, then drain pasta and lentils</li>
        <li>Add 8-10 tsp of sundried tomato paste, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, salt to liking (if you're not sure how much, start with two pinches), and 1 tsp balsamic vinegar (add more if needed). Mix all together and wait for paste to become hot.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and lentils back into pan and stir.</li>
        <li>Taste test, add more salt if needed, and serve.</li>
       </ol>
